Objects and its Internal Representation in JavaScript :

 1.Objects are essential for organizing and manipulating data in JavaScript,
  and they play a central role in the language's flexibility and power.

 2.In JavaScript, objects are collections of key-value pairs, where keys are strings,
  and values can be of various data types, including other objects. 

 3. Objects allow you to group related data and behavior together,
  making it easier to manage and work with complex structures.

 4.Properties: Objects consist of properties, which are key-value pairs.
  Each property has a name and a corresponding value.
  Properties can be added, updated, or removed dynamically.

 5.Prototype Chain: JavaScript objects also have a prototype chain.
  This chain allows objects to inherit properties and methods from their prototypes.
  
 6.Objects are a cornerstone of the language, enabling you to model and manipulate complex data structures.

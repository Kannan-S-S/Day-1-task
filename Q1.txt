
HTTP/1.1 :
    
 1.In HTTP/1.1, requests and responses are processed sequentially. 
 2.This means that each asset is requested one at a time, leading to a phenomenon known as "head-of-line blocking."
 3.If one resource takes a long time to load, it delays the entire page rendering process.
 4.To overcome the sequential processing issue, browsers opened multiple connections to a server to fetch resources in parallel.
 5.In each request, the client sends a significant amount of redundant header data, including cookies and user-agent information.

HTTP/2 :

 1.HTTP/2 allows multiple requests and responses to be multiplexed over a single connection. 
 2.One of the most significant enhancements in HTTP/2 is multiplexing.
 3.This eliminates the head-of-line blocking issue and significantly improves page load times.
 4.HTTP/2 introduces header compression techniques that significantly reduce the size of header data. 
 5.HTTP/2 is designed to be backward-compatible with HTTP/1.1, which means that even if a server supports HTTP/2,
  it can still serve content to clients using HTTP/1.1.
